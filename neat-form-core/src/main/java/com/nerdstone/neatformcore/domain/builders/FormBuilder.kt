/**
 * [FormBuilder] contract is implemented by any builder using any preferred Schema.
 *
 * [formString] is the string representation of the form depending on the schema which can be JSON
 * YAML or even XML
 *
 * The form builder also uses the [formValidator] to validate fields.
 *
 * Before building views, views are first registered withing the [registeredViews] map. This is a map
 * that holds the view type against the actual class type of the view that will used to create the view for example
 *              for an EditText inside the view type map you will have
 *              ["edit_text" -> EditTextNFormView::class]
 *
 * Optionally you can pass default styling for widgets using the [resourcesMap]. Each of the styles defined in the
 * map will be applied to the respective views. The resources map can be used to store any type of Android resource e.g. drawables and style
 *
 * Example: assuming in your map you have declared this [edit_text_style -> R.style.globalEditTextStyle] and in the
 * This map can be overridden if you have custom views that you also want rendered. Just remember to register the views
 * before building the form.
